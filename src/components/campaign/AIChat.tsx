    "why did engagement drop from day 14 to day 21": `Between Day 14 and Day 21 after Mutation 2, engagement saw a decline. During this interval, we tested a variant ad where the game element was swapped with Minecraft, but the rest of the visualâ€”especially the Cola productâ€”remained unchanged.

ðŸŽ¯ Here's what likely happened:

Audience fatigue: The core creative (featuring the Cola) was already familiar. Swapping only the game without refreshing the overall context may not have been novel enough to spark interest.

Mismatch in novelty: Minecraft has a nostalgic and specific fan base, but without cohesive changes to the ad's tone or messaging, it may have created a visual incongruity, making the update feel random instead of intentional.`,

    "why did engagement rise so rapidly from day 21 to day 28": `From Day 21 to Day 28, we observed a notable spike in engagement, coinciding with Mutation 3: the Cola product color was changed to a vibrant green.

ðŸ”¬ Here's the breakdown:

Visual disruption drove curiosity: The unexpected color shift in a well-known product acted as a pattern interrupt. This sort of novelty triggers attention and drives user interaction.

Social virality effect: Such radical changes often lead to users sharing the ad or commenting, asking "Why is the Coke green?"â€”even if subconsciously. This builds hype loops.

Perceived special edition: Green product variants are often seen as limited editions or event-based tie-ins. Viewers might have speculated on exclusivity or thematic relevance (e.g. gaming collab, Earth Day), further boosting interaction.`,

    "is this sustainable": `âœ… Yes â€” by design.

The intent behind Mutation 3 (turning the Cola drink green) was to ignite short-term hype through visual disruption. This tactic succeeded by amplifying attention and interaction.

ðŸ’¡ What makes it sustainable:

This was a strategic burst, not a permanent shift.

At Mutation 4, scheduled for post-Day 28, the ad will revert to the original Cola design, restoring familiarity.

This oscillation between shock and stability helps keep the audience engaged without oversaturating them with gimmicks.

ðŸ“Š In essence: We leveraged novelty to reinvigorate the audience, and now we anchor the campaign with a return to the classic. This rhythm is key to long-term campaign health.`
