# Video Gallery Demo Files

To use your own videos in the gallery:

2. Name them video1.mp4, video2.mp4, ..., video16.mp4
3. Recommended specs: 
   - Short clips (5-15 seconds)
   - 16:9 aspect ratio
   - H.264 codec for best compatibility

The gallery will automatically display your videos once they are added to this folder.
